# map_muscles
Lo√Øc's semester project repository. The goal is to align the muscles segmented in a X-ray dataset with the ones observed in the Flytracker's muscle imaging

This git repository contains all the necessary scripts to:
- Perform calibration of the muscle and kinematic camera
- Extract the muscles from the xRay dataset
- Link muscles and muscle activity
